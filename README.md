# Overview

In this project, [helius.dev](https://www.helius.dev) and [quicknode.com](https://quicknode.com) are used.
Helius is being used for RPC websocket connection, where Quicknode serves us as a Jupiter Swap API.
It is not required at all, but the project in current state requires it, therefore if you're using different provider, adjust the code accordingly.
